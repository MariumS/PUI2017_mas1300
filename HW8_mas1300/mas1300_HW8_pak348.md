#### Hi Marium,
#### It was a good attempt to plot the Subway stations in the NYC Map.

#### Below are a few suggestions/improvisations:
#### 1. It was a good idea to include gridlines in the plot, however in this case the gridlines do improve in identifying the co-ordinates if the station.
#### 2. It is not clear what the different colors of the Subway Stations denote. It would be nice to include a legend for them.
#### 3. The Caption could be modified as “Map Showing Subway Locations in New York City” to make it simple and provide better clarity.
#### 4. One other Small correction would be using Capital first letter for Latitude and Longitude.
#### 5. You could have excluded Staten Island by Mentioning a note – “No Subway Stations at Staten Island” to have zoomed in increased the resolution of the image and make effective use of space.
#### Best,
#### Praveen
